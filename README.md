# Sign Up Form

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Technologies used

* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* This project uses the Javascript form validation API.
* Bonus: I actually used [quotable API](https://api.quotable.io) to generate the random quotes.
